# Discord Usernames Checker

## Introduction

This diabolical Python script allows you to check the availability of Discord usernames in a multi-threaded manner, supporting proxy usage for added anonymity and speed. The code base was inspired by @suegdu, and we've made it even more malevolent by adding threading and proxy support.

## Features

- Multi-token Support: You can use multiple Discord bot tokens to maximize your username-checking capacity and overcome rate limitations.

- Proxy Support: Integrate proxies into the script to avoid IP bans and increase your chances of success when checking usernames.

- Threading Support: The script harnesses the power of threading to perform checks concurrently, significantly speeding up the process.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Prepare a list of Discord tokens and store them in a file named `config.ini`.
3. If you desire to use proxies, prepare a list of proxies and store them in a file named `proxies.txt`, one proxy per line in the format `http://proxy_ip:port`.
4. 6. Execute the script with the following command: `python PassChecker.py`

The initial inspiration for this wicked script came from <a href="https://github.com/suegdu/Discord-Username-Checker">suegdu</a>**<br>, but I've edit it.
